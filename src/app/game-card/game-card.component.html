        <h2>Aurum</h2>
        <p>Aurum is a trick-taking game for three or four players, with two teams of two competing in the four-player
            game.
            After all cards for the round have been dealt, you bid on how many tricks you think you/your team will win.
            (In a four-player game, the higher of the two bids on a team becomes the team's bid.)
